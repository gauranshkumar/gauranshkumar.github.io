I am Gauransh Kumar, a first-year Computer Science Master's student at the [**GEODES**](https://geodes.iro.umontreal.ca/) and [**RALI**](https://rali.iro.umontreal.ca/rali/?q=fr) labs within the department of Computer Science and Operations Research (DIRO) at [**Université de Montréal**](https://rali.iro.umontreal.ca/rali/?q=fr).

My research interests lie in Software Engineering and Natural Language Processing. My primary research focuses on applying NLP techniques and LLMs in Software Engineering Systematic Literature Review (SLR). The goal is to automate the Screening phase of SLR using NLP techniques and LLMs.

I received my Bachelor's degree from [**Maharaja Agrasen Institue Of Technology**](https://mait.ac.in), Delhi, India, in 2023, majoring in Computer Science and Engineering. During this time, my first Research internship was at Université de Montréal as a **Mitacs Globalink Research Intern 2022** under the supervision of [**Prof. Eugene Syriani**](http://www.iro.umontreal.ca/~syriani/). I was shortlisted from a pool of more than 20,000 applications worldwide, a testament to the global recognition of my work. Apart from this, I also gained corporate exposure as a **DevOps Intern** at [**Datazip**](https://datazip.io/) and Technical Staff Intern at [**AIcrowd**](https://www.aicrowd.com/).
